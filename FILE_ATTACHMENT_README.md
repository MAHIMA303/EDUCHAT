- Works on both mobile and web platforms

### 2. File Selection UI
- Attachment button (paperclip icon) in the chat input area
- File picker opens when attachment button is pressed
- Selected files are stored in `_selectedFile` variable

### 3. File Preview
- Selected files show a preview container above the chat input
- Displays file icon and filename
